**Overview**

The DSA Library is designed to provide developers with a collection of fundamental data structures and algorithms commonly used in computer science and software engineering projects. It aims to be easy to use, efficient, and well-documented.

**Installation**

To use the DSA Library in your C++ projects, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine:
- bash
- Copy code

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dsa-library.git

- Include the necessary header files (BinaryTree.h, TreeNode.h, etc.) in your C++ project.
- Compile your project with the DSA Library files.

**Usage**

Here's a basic example of how to use the DSA Library:

```
#include <iostream>

#include "binary_tree.h"

int main() {

    BinaryTree<int> *tree = new BinaryTree<int>();

    tree->insert(7);

    tree->insert(4);

    tree->insert(5);

    tree->insert(9);

    tree->insert(8);

    // Perform operations on the tree

    tree->levelOrderTraversal();

    delete tree; // Remember to free memory

    return 0;

}

```

**Supported Operations**

The DSA Library currently supports the following operations:

- Insertion of elements into a binary tree
- Searching for elements in a binary tree
- Traversal of binary trees (inorder, preorder, postorder, level-order)
- Retrieving the height and size of a binary tree
